Lilypond tutorial: How to write tunebooks using [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/).

This tutorial (PDF [here](https://github.com/tomcam/lilypond-tutorial/blob/master/How%20to%20create%20a%20tunebook%20with%20Lilypond.pdf)) shows you how to typeset standard Western music with the following characteristics:

1. Melody
2. Lyrics
3. Chord symbols

So far only the melody part has been written down, and it's a very rough draft. If you have any problems or suggestions please [file an issue](https://github.com/tomcam/lilypond-tutorial/issues) or just email me at tomcampbell at gmail dot com.
